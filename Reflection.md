1. I used the gutenberg website to obtain the romeo and juliet text. I used different functions in an attempt to find out the frequencies of all the words in the text, the top 10 most common words, and compared which words in Romeo and Juliet are not in the hamlet. I also wanted to try and use the similarity function however I was having troule importing the fuzz function. With attempting all these functions, I was attempting to hone in on some of the things we practiced in our exercises as well as try something new in the similarity function.

2. I mainly tried to draw from what I learned in the previous exercises and implement them in the code I did for assignment 2. That meant obtaining a histogram dictionary for the Romeo and Juliet text and making sure only the words in the actual story was used. Then I could utilize the functions that I had learned in the exercises to draw some analysis from the histogram. When deciding on a function to try new, I decided to use the similarity function because it would showcase similar words between the two texts. And because both texts were written by Williams Shakespeare, I would be able to compare how similar he would write between text.

3. Unfortunately, my results are pretty messed up since I was never able to successfully make the histogram dictionary. I tried utilizing the previous exercises to carefully help me make the dictionary but for some reason it did not work this time. I tried figuring out the issue to no avail. Therefore, there really is no results, but if I were to successfully create the dictionary, I believe these functions would work to create valid results.

4. Honestly, not much went well considering I couldn't figure out the dictionary part which is probably the most important part of the project and I just ran out of time. I hope next time I can successfully efficiently trouble shoot the problem. Before doing the assignment, I thought I had a pretty good plan of what I wanted to do, it is just the execution that obviously needs work. I hope that next time I can spend more time to figure out this issue so I can do better on the assignment.
